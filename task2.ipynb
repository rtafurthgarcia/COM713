    "# Task 1 Perspectives on Python-oriented SBOM Generation Tools\n",
    "Task 1 analysed current SBOM generation practices in the Python ecosystem and identified a fundamental limitation: existing tools rely primarily on metadata files or semi-dynamic installation processes, leading to incomplete dependency discovery and inconsistent results. Through critical synthesis of recent academic work, the first part motivates a new SBOM generation approach that shifts the focus from metadata-centric analysis to source-code–level dependency discovery.\n",
    "This part is now dedicated to the implementation of our novel approach. Using Python’s Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to extract imports directly from source code and construct a dependency graph, we complement existing methods and seek to achieve 100% completeness. \n",
    "The first section is about the choice of data structure appropriate for graph problems. The second section is about the project's chosen datasets, why and how they've been merged. The third one is about the AST analysis itself, focused on the 1st dataset, whilst the second part is mostly about the results' analysis of the 2nd dataset. The final section discusses limitations as well as everything related to asymptotic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nota bene\n",
    "1. In the first task, under Comparison and metrics, we suggest correctness will be also assessed. This was a mistake; the focus of this project remains exclusively about completeness, as in capturing all dependencies.  \n",
    "2. This project revolving around packages, to run the AST analyser and obtain the expected results, one needs to copy the ***whole*** repository[https://github.com/rtafurthgarcia/COM713], because the datasets also contain the dependencies!"

    "## 1 Data structures \n",
    "One could conceive the data structure defining how packages relate to one another naively as a tree, where each package may have children-packages. In fact, it is often referred in the literature as a dependency tree. However, \n",
    "this term misrepresents the true nature of software dependencies, for packages rarely have a single parent relationship or even form (problematic) cycles, per Tellnes' own introduction of the problem[1]. Thus, in professional software development, dependency graphs are the norm. For this reason, the core data structure featured in this document will be shaped by graph theory. Goodrich et al.[2] provide us with four possible data structures: \n",
    "1. edge lists \n",
    "2. adjacency list\n",
    "3. adjacency map\n",
    "4. adjacency matrix \n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst in the task n°1 it had been concluded that the adjacency list had to be used for NodeVisitor depended on it, \n",
    "it turned out that `ast.NodeVisitor` doesnt really expect a specific type. We were thus free to choose any of those data structures. One could choose the edge list on a whim, for it is easy to implement, and has the most optimal for the three functions we would use (`vertices()` being O(n), `insert_vertices()` and `insert_edges()` being O(1)), as described in [2, p.627], to construct the graph and compare it against others. But doing so would be a mistake; we cannot forget some projects might have cycles and for this reason we need to be able to avoid duplicates. Replacing the lists by sets would mean both the getter and setter necessary to check for duplicates before adding are O(n) too[3]. Therefore it would have best to use a adjacency map, for its getter `get_edge()` is O(1), but our dataset needs to exported and merged too, implying serialisation is a major challenge for behavior-heavy objects like graphs. Bad experience has been made about this last part, as visible in our chatgpt transcript[4]. Hence we reverted back to the first option that was the edge lists, but with sets instead, for we will only implement a small subset of functions where O(1) applies. Sets allow for easy comparisons, perfect for later analyses. It is important to note that python's sets make us of hashmaps, which for insertion and look-ups are worth O(1) too. We follow Goodrich et al.'s edge list implementation otherwise[3]."

Due to the sheer size of those datasets (multiple GBs), they are not included in this file directly and can be consulted on the (project's github repository)[https://github.com/rtafurthgarcia/COM713].\n",

However, if curious as to how it worked, you can peek into the `merge.py` file and see how it got done. It required serialising our dataclasses from above into json files. By merging is meant combining all previous relevant dataset files into one, but we keep both datasets distinct for practical reasons. Deserialising those datasets meant implementing `from_dict` functions as to retroactively convert all nested objects into their original types."
